    <h2>For you,</h2>

    <p>
     well i guess, i am not afraid of committing into a relationship at all, but at what cost and for what reason kung ikaw ang hindi pa ready.
hindi ka pa ba talaga handa o sadyang hindi lang ako ang gusto one thing is for sure, if you ever open your heart for me again, i'll be your own kind of 'all-rounder'.
      i will be your bestfriend if you want someone to fool around with at the moment.
      i will be you father if you need someone to take care of you. i will be your study-buddy if you feel like studying alone makes you lose motivation.
      i will be your human diary if you want to vent everything that happens in your little life but at the same time, 
      i will be your human handkerchief if you don't want to say anything and just wait to cry. lastly, will be your lover in any occasions, in any seasons, and in any lifetimes. 
      i will be everything you need, just let me try again.
      can we start all over again, adi? i always wanted us, im sorry for leaving you :( i really want to fix us, 
      i will love you the same way, i really miss you adi. just give me one chance to love you again, this time gagawin ko na lahat ng hindi ko nagawa sayo noon.
      i just wanted you to know  that having you is already more than enough, you're the person i want to be with :( 
      gaya ng kanta ng silent sanctuary "walang ibang tatanggapin, ikaw at ikaw parin"
      I MISS YOU SO MUCH ADI :(
